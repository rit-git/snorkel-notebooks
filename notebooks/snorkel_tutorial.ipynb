Resistance is useless. They will overwhelm you - one at a time.\\n: Your neighbors will not help you. They will consider you more if an\\n: immediate threat than the abstract 'criminal'. \\n\\n  Oooh, WACO II, coming to your living room soon...  When was the last\\n  time you turned off your TV?  Can't remember?  I thought so...\\n\\n: Too fucking bad. You have gone the way of the KKK. Violent solutions\\n: are passe'. Avoid situations which encourage criminals. Then you will\\n: be as safe as possible. Such as it is ...\\n\\n  Wait, I got it, this is a late April fool post, right?  I didn't\\n  think ANYBODY is stupid enough to post something like this...good one\\n  guys, this group was getting boring without Holly and Susan.    \n",
       "327  \\nNot to mention last year's Weaver affair.\\n\\nAnyway, here's how I see the Waco affair; I'd be interested in other peoples'\\ninterpretations...\\n\\n1. Koresh and his people were basically minding their own business.\\n2. Some weapons violations may have been committed and I wouldn't have\\n   disapproved of prosecuting him for those violations.  However, I think\\n   the BATF was criminal for starting negotiations with a military style\\n   assault and for firing into a house where there were children and other\\n   noncombatants.\\n3. I don't see they couldn't just leave a token guard on the place and wait\\n   the BDs out; I don't approve of the tear gas approach and, if it caused\\n   the fire to be started, I think the FBI agent responsible should spend\\n   10-20 years in jail.\\n4. However, if Koresh's response to the tear gas was to kill everyone there,\\n   I hold him largely responsible for their deaths.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

The noise you hear is due to the momentary\\nopening and closing of the path.\\n\\nThe noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In high\\nimpedance audio circuits a resistive \"T\" is constructed close to characteristic\\nimpedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfers\\nthe audio.\\n\\nIn low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are\\nshorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic\\nimpedance.\\n\\nSometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used\\nto momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.\\n\\nTelephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to \"Make before\\nbreak and Vica Versa\" but I haven't seen any of these for years.\\n\\nNowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.\\n\\nA novel circuit I used to build was a primitive \"optical isolator\".. It consists\\nof a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp is\\noff the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers\\npassing the audio.  Once again this device in a \"T\" switches the audio.  Varying\\nthe lamp resistance give a remote volume control.

Not to prejudge the\\nguy, but he looked like a neo-nazi.  He also said he\\nexpected many neo-nazis to show up throughout the trial.\\n\"Tim\" had been handing out leaflets in support of Weaver\\nand Harris and the news had footage of a Boise cop\\ntelling him to move along or he'd arrest.  I don't know\\nthe finer points of this one.  Perhaps there's a law\\nagainst political activity within X feet of a courthouse\\nor something (what happenned to the First Amendment?!?).\\n\\nMost ominous of all was that the local reporter filmed\\nan agent of the Gestapo...err...ATF with a minicam\\nFILMING THE PROTESTORS!  Welcome to the world of Big Brother.\\n\\nAnyhow, Gerry Spence came out and asked the protestors to\\nleave because he didn't think it would help Weaver's case\\nany.

       "1019  \\nAs a general rule, no relay will cleanly switch audio if you try to tranfer\\nthe circuit with the contacts.  The noise you hear is due to the momentary\\nopening and closing of the path.\\n\\nThe noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In high\\nimpedance audio circuits a resistive \"T\" is constructed close to characteristic\\nimpedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfers\\nthe audio.\\n\\nIn low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are\\nshorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic\\nimpedance.\\n\\nSometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used\\nto momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.\\n\\nTelephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to \"Make before\\nbreak and Vica Versa\" but I haven't seen any of these for years.\\n\\nNowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.\\n\\nA novel circuit I used to build was a primitive \"optical isolator\".. It consists\\nof a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp is\\noff the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers\\npassing the audio.  Once again this device in a \"T\" switches the audio.  Varying\\nthe lamp resistance give a remote volume control.

According the the Los Angeles Police Department, illegal\\nmanufacture is one the three primary sources of machine guns and\\nsubmachine guns used in crimes (sumggling and theft from the\\npolice and military being the other two.) Washington D.C. police\\nhave stated that 40% (If I'm remembering the figure correctly) of\\nthe guns they conficate were illegally built.\\n\\n\\nIt takes about 6 hours and a few tools to make one (at least one\\nof reasonable quality). Unless the drug dealer enjoyes messing\\naround on a lathe (say, as a hobby), he's going to have to \\npay someone anyway. Materials plus six hours of a machinist's\\ntime for something legal would run about $100. The blackmarket\\nprices for guns are usually in the $50 to $200 range (at least\\nthose few I've seen cited in newspaper articles were...)\\n\\n\\nWashington D.C. has a total ban on handguns and prohibits assembled\\nrifles within city limits. It's homicide rate is almost ten\\ntimes the national average. It is also illegal for a D.C.\\nresident to drive to the Virginia or Maryland suburbs and\\nbuy a gun (dealers are required by federal law to check IDs\\nand make sure the buyer isn't from another state) so the ban \\ncan not be easily side-stepped.\\n\\n\\nSure. But it you couldn't buy one, you would write your own (in\\nfact, people _did_ write their own 15 years ago...) More likely,\\nyou would find a friend who was a particularly good programer\\nand get him give you a copy of his. Software is a _very_ bad\\nexample for your case: How many people do you know with illegal\\ncopies of $400 word processors? If people want something, and\\nit isn't available (or affordable) legally, they will usually\\nget it illegally.\\n\\n\\nQuite.\\n\\n\\n13-3-2. The formula has been around for half a million years.\\nOr are you going to restrict sales of sulpher, charcoal and\\nsaltpeter? That's alot cruder than modern smokless powder, but\\nit works very well. The only real problems are a ~25% reduction\\nin energy (so a .357 magnum would \"only\" be as deadly as a 9mm)\\nand it makes alot more smoke... Of course, a smart black marketeer\\ncould just make the gun in 9mm and steal the ammunition from the\\npolice (the police are often corruptable, and things are known\\nto disappear from police evidence rooms and armories and\\nreappear on the streets...)\\n\\n\\nPerhaps you weren't watching the news two years ago, but the Serbs \\nalso tried to invade Slovinia. They were driven out after a few\\nweeks by partisans armed with home-made _anti-tank_ weapons.\\nThe Afghan rebels frequently made their own rifles.</td>\n",

Unless the drug dealer enjoyes messing\\naround on a lathe (say, as a hobby), he's going to have to \\npay someone anyway.
